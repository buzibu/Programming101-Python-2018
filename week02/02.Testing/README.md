Testing
========================

Let's rewrite tasks - https://docs.python.org/3.4/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists.
The condition is to using TDD (Test Driven Development) flow.

After that, let's start with coding new problems and tests. You should think how the user can break your code. So you have to add validations. :)

## Simplify fractions

Implement a function, called ```simplify_fraction(fraction)``` that takes a tuple of the form ```(nominator, denominator)``` and simplifies the fraction.

The function should return the fraction in it's irreducible form.

For example, a fraction ```3/9``` can be reduced by dividing both the nominator and the denominator by 3. We end up with ```1/3``` which is irreducible.

### Signature

```python
def simplify_fraction(fraction):
    # Implementation
```

### Test examples

```
>>> simplify_fraction((3,9))
(1,3)
>>> simplify_fraction((1,7))
(1,7)
>>> simplify_fraction((4,10))
(2,5)
>>> simplify_fraction((63,462))
(3,22)
```

## Collect fractions

Implement a function, called ```collect_fractions(fractions)``` where ```fractions``` is a list of tuples of the form ```(nominator, denominator)```.

Both the nominator and the denominator are integers.
The function should return the sum of the fractions.

### Signature

```python
def collect_fractions(fractions):
    # Implementation
```

### Test examples

```
>>> collect_fractions([(1, 4), (1, 2)])
(3, 4)
>>> collect_fractions([(1, 7), (2, 6)])
(10,21)
```


## Sort array of fractions

Implement a function, called ```sort_fractions(fractions)``` where ```fractions``` is a list of tuples of the form ```(nominator, denominator)```.

Both the nominator and the denominator are integers.

The function should return the list, sorted in increasing order.

### Signature

```python
def sort_fractions(fractions):
    # Implementation
```

### Test examples

```
>>> sort_fractions([(2, 3), (1, 2)])
[(1, 2), (2, 3)]
>>> sort_fractions([(2, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3)])
[(1, 3), (1, 2), (2, 3)]
>>> sort_fractions([(5, 6), (22, 78), (22, 7), (7, 8), (9, 6), (15, 32)])
[(22, 78), (15, 32), (5, 6), (7, 8), (9, 6), (22, 7)]
```
