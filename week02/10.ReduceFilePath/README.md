## Reduce file path

A file path in a Unix OS looks like this - `/home/rositsazz/courses/Programming101-Python-2018/week02`

We start from the root - `/` and we navigate to the destination folder.

But there is a problem - if we have `..` and `.` in our file path, it's not clear where we are going to end up.

* `..` means to go back one directory
* `.`  means to stay in the same directory
* we can have more then one `/` between the directories - `/home//code`

So for example : `/home//rositsazz/courses/./Programming101-Python-2018/week02/../` reduces to `/home/rositsazz/courses/Programming101-Python-2018/week02`.


Implement a function, called `reduce_file_path(path)` which takes a string and returns the reduced version of the path.

* Every `..` means that we have to go one directory back
* Every `.` means that we are staying in the same directory
* Every extra `/` is unnecessary
* Always remove the last `/`

## Signature
```python
def reduce_file_path(path):
    pass
```

## Test examples
```python
>>> reduce_file_path("/")
"/"
>>> reduce_file_path("/srv/../")
"/"
>>> reduce_file_path("/srv/www/htdocs/wtf/")
"/srv/www/htdocs/wtf"
>>> reduce_file_path("/srv/www/htdocs/wtf")
"/srv/www/htdocs/wtf"
>>> reduce_file_path("/srv/./././././")
"/srv"
>>> reduce_file_path("/etc//wtf/")
"/etc/wtf"
>>> reduce_file_path("/etc/../etc/../etc/../")
"/"
>>> reduce_file_path("//////////////")
"/"
>>> reduce_file_path("/../")
"/"
```
